# Bridget
My name is Bridget Nakakande, and I am a dedicated Software Developer with a strong background in Web and Android Development.

One of my recent achievements is a project that supports parents in Kenya who are navigating the Competency-based Curriculum (CBC). The goal is to provide them with easy access to learning resources and boost parental engagement in their children's academics. Through research and product management, I have been working on a mobile application, MzaziConnect that enables parents to conveniently access the resources. The project focuses on user experience, providing an intuitive platform for parents to find relevant materials and actively support their children's education within the CBC framework and increasing parental engagement to 100%. This is a significant improvement over the current rate of parental engagement, and it has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of children and families in Kenya.

As a Software Developer with experience on a variety of projects (available on my GitHub profile), I am proficient in Python (Django), JavaScript (React), and Kotlin for Android development. I am also actively learning about data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and natural language processing. I am passionate about using data and machine learning to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.

I am currently seeking opportunities to leverage my skills and experience to make a meaningful contribution to a team and organization that shares my values and is eager to take challenges working with diverse projects.
